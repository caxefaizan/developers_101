## IDE
We will be using VS Code for the development . However you can use any IDE of your choice.
Based on your OS download the appropriate version of visual studio from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## GIT
Now that we are all set the very first skill across all domains is to know about version controlling methodologies such as Git.
Follow the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN63v_czZqI) to learn the fundamentals about version control.

## Linux
Love it or Hate it, You will have to use it. For a smooth developer experience Linux is the OS to use and that's why we we will download Ubuntu(A flavor of Linux).
Now the next thing would be to learn the fundamentals of Linux so you can always debug your application on the standard OS across the industry i.e LINUX
Here's a video to get you started. [Linux Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1y-mbWM3B8).

>**Note:** 
>
>* If you are on Windows, I'd recommend installing WSL2 for Windows to follow along in the course. Follow the [link](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview) to get started.
>
>* After Ubuntu is installed on your WSL2, Open VS Code and open Extensions `(Ctrl+Shift+X)` and search for Remote - WSL and install it.
>
>* Now click on the Green Button on the bottom left corner to start a remote window (Ubuntu), and then click on `New WSL Window Using Distro` and finally select `Ubuntu 20.04`
>
>This opens a workspace in your Ubuntu WSL2

## Networking
We all hate it but your software needs to be restricted and also allowed across the internet. And often you will hear about networking terminologies. Here's a video to ensure that you don't get an impostor syndrome at work for not knowing it.FYI We all feel it :D -> [Networking Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqsXzkXfwRw).

## Your First Assignment
- I can't emphasize it enough but what makes you a great developer is how well you can document your work. Hence the first thing we shall do is clone this repo and either beautify it or add any additional info that shall be useful for your upcoming colleagues. Note- We are not looking to share subject expert material here.
> So let's start with having a section for developers and then a section of skills they have with proper hyperlinks.
- Once our batch is onboarded with the fundamentals above, we can jump on to our internal full stack project [here](https://github.com/caxefaizan/slackapp).
> Here you can either choose to work on the front end of the application, backend of the application or the cloud operations of the app. Well if you love being a full stack dev. The stage is yours. Note: For the Slack App our Dependant frameworks are : Python, GCP, Flask, HTML, Postgres.
